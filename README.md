## **src** structure
The source directory is divided in three parts:
1. **qr** folder - contains the basic algorithm of the QR factorisation (qr\_mod.m) and a batch for time measuring (qrmeasure.m) 
2. **cg** folder - contains the conjugate gradient method implementation (conjugate\_gradient.m) and a batch for time measuring (cgmeasure.m). It also has the conjugate gradient method with the orthogonality correction (conjugate\_gradient\_corrected.m).
3. **qr_blockwise** folder - contains the enhanced version of the QR factorisation (qr\_mod\_bw.m) and a batch for time measuring
(qrbwmeasure.m).
