## **src** structure
The source directory is divided in three parts:
	1. **qr** folder - contains the basic algorithm of the QR factorisation
	2. **cg** folder - contains the conjugate gradient method implementation
	3. **qr_blockwise** folder - contains the enhanced version of the QR factorisation

Each of the above folders contains also a corresponding batch written in Matlab, which can
be exploited for time measuring of the solution in the same folder.
